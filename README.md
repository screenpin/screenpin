ScreenPin allows you to create ScreenPins which will not leave your screen until you close or minimize them. You can add text notes, a website view, a pdf or an image.

ScreenPin lets you refer to a note, site or file whilst never needing to resize your main window.

ScreenPin is a actively maintained open-source project so expect new features often.
